## Pre-trained-Model:
The pre-trained Models Ernie and Pegasus used in the paper have been uploaded to the folder “Model”* [`Model`], you can also download them from the following links:
  * **Ernie**: [https://huggingface.co/nghuyong/ernie-3.0-medium-zh](https://huggingface.co/nghuyong/ernie-3.0-medium-zh)

## Deep_learning:
### Abstractive summarization
* `train.py`: Use this file to train the model.
* `predict.py`: You can use this file to load the trained model and extract the summary directly.
* `checkpoints`: This folder is my trained model for text summarization.

### Hierarchical text classification


## LLMEvaluate:
The folder contains code for extracting cognitive pathways of depression patients using LLM.
