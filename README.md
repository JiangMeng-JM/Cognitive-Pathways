## Introduction:
This repository contains all the data and code necessary for replicating the experiments in the paper. Additionally, it provides a set of tools for implementing automatic extraction of cognitive pathways. You can package it into an executable (.exe) for use by non-professionals.
The directory structure is as follows:
 
* **Deep_learning**:
The folder contains code for extracting cognitive pathways of depression patients using deep learning models.

* **Model**:
The folder contains pre-trained models Ernie and Pegasus used in the paper. You can also download them from the following links:
  * **Ernie**: [https://huggingface.co/nghuyong/ernie-3.0-medium-zh](https://huggingface.co/nghuyong/ernie-3.0-medium-zh)
  * **Pegasus**: [https://huggingface.co/IDEA-CCNL/Randeng-Pegasus-523M-Summary-Chinese](https://huggingface.co/IDEA-CCNL/Randeng-Pegasus-523M-Summary-Chinese)

* **LLMEvaluate**:
The folder contains code for extracting cognitive pathways of depression patients using LLM.

* **Web_Tool**:
The folder contains code for designing a web page. On this webpage, users can upload and import a text file of a Patient Statement. Subsequently, our deep learning model will be utilized to extract the cognitive pathway of the patient.
